# 🌱 AgriSense: Smart Agriculture Data & Prediction System

AgriSense is a **Streamlit-based machine learning project** designed to assist farmers and researchers by analyzing agricultural datasets and providing predictions on crop yield, weather patterns, and plant health.  
It also includes a **CNN model** to detect plant diseases from images.
